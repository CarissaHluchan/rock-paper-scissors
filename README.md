# üëä‚úåÔ∏è‚úã[Rock Paper Scissors](https://carissahluchan.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)üëä‚úåÔ∏è‚úã

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The website I built is a game to play two versions of Rock, Paper, Scissors, a classic version, and a more difficult version with five fighter choices adding a lizard and alien/UFO. Users can select from either game and play against a computer. The user can select a fighter with a click. A view of their selection and the computer's randomly selected fighter is displayed with a token below the choices. A message is displayed informing the user of who won. The score is kept on the left and right sides of the screen counting for each player's wins. If the user clicks the change game button the home page is viewable and the score is reset to 0.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Click the deploy link to play the game or follow these steps:
- Fork this project to your own Github account.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- `cd` into the project folder.
- Use the `open index.html` command to view the webpage.

### Preview of App:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am a Front-End developer in the 6th week of an intensive Software Development Bootcamp. It took me 5 days of work to complete and I kept track of my work using GitHub project board.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
This was a solo project.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The goals for the project included:
Solidify and demonstrate understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Using a problem-solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
I used my knowledge of supporting functions to reactor the code for better readability. I learned about setTimeout global functions and how to apply them in JavaScript. I tested the games to identify bugs and addressed these. One included a function guard to allow for a click to be in progress.
